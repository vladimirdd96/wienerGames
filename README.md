# Node.js Developer Task
MAIN TASK:
Objective: Create an API for simulating a slot casino game with three endpoints.
Endpoints:
1. POST /play:
- Executes a random spin.
- Calculates and returns the final symbol matrix and winnings.
2. POST /sim:
- Accepts a parameter "count" which specifies the number of spins to simulate.
- Returns the total profit or loss from the specified number of spins.
3. GET /rtp:
- Returns the Return to Player (RTP) percentage based on all spins made so far (total bets vs. total
winnings).

## Requirements:
1. RNG Integration:
- Integrate an existing Random Number Generator (RNG) library for random selection.
2. Slot Game Logic:
- Operates on a 3x3 matrix.
- Uses 3 predefined rows of symbols with 5 different symbols.
- Randomly selects 3 positions using the RNG.
- Calculates winnings: Each combination of 3 identical symbols in a row wins 5 times the bet.
3. Detailed Functionality:
- /play: Executes a single random spin, calculates the winnings, and returns the final symbol matrix
and winnings.
- /sim: Accepts a "count" parameter, performs the specified number of spins, and returns the total
profit or loss.
- /rtp: Returns the RTP percentage based on all spins made so far (total bets vs. total winnings).
BONUS REQUIREMENTS:
1. Error Handling:
- Implement robust error handling for all endpoints.
- Ensure the API gracefully handles invalid input, such as missing or incorrect parameters.
- Return appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages.
2. Automated Tests:
- Write automated tests to ensure the correctness of the implemented functionality.
- Include unit tests for individual components and integration tests for the API endpoints.
3. Wallet Logic:
- Implement a "wallet" system to manage player balances.
- Add logic to handle deposits and withdrawals.
- Ensure the balance is correctly updated after each play and simulation.
- Implement error handling for scenarios such as insufficient balance.

## DETAILED TASK BREAKDOWN:
### MAIN TASK:
#### 1. POST /play:
- Request Body: { "bet": number }
- Response: { "matrix": string[][], "winnings": number }
- Functionality:
- Deduct the bet amount from the player's wallet.
- Perform a random spin using the RNG.
- Calculate the winnings based on the final symbol matrix.
- Update the player's wallet with the winnings.
- Return the final symbol matrix and winnings.
#### 2. POST /sim:
- Request Body: { "count": number, "bet": number }
- Response: { "totalWinnings": number, "netResult": number }
- Functionality:
- Deduct the total bet amount (bet * count) from the player's wallet.
- Perform the specified number of spins.
- Calculate the total winnings and net result (total winnings - total bet).
- Update the player's wallet with the total winnings.
- Return the total winnings and net result.
#### 3. GET /rtp:

- Response: { "rtp": number }
- Functionality:
- Calculate the RTP percentage based on all spins made so far.
- Return the RTP percentage.
### BONUS REQUIREMENTS:
#### 1. Error Handling:
- Validate request parameters and return 400 Bad Request for invalid input.
- Return 500 Internal Server Error for unexpected errors.
- Provide meaningful error messages to the client.
#### 2. Automated Tests:
- Use a testing framework (e.g., Mocha, Jest) to write unit and integration tests.
- Test individual components such as RNG integration, spin logic, and wallet updates.
- Test the API endpoints to ensure they return correct responses and handle errors appropriately.
#### 3. Wallet Logic:
- Implement endpoints for managing the player's wallet:
- POST /wallet/deposit: Adds funds to the player's wallet.
- POST /wallet/withdraw: Withdraws funds from the player's wallet.
- GET /wallet/balance: Returns the current balance.
- Ensure the wallet balance is updated correctly after each play and simulation.
- Handle errors such as insufficient balance for a bet or withdrawal.

### BONUS FE REQUIREMENTS:
- Front-end extra task: Create a visual representation of the game using React. Connect the game to the local API from the backend task and visualize:

    3x3 reels matrix
    spin button for triggering a spin - animate reels spinning
    balance visualization and current bet (can be FE only for the session)
    win visualization and balance updates
